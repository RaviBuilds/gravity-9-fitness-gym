/**
 * Master pricing/membership data — the single source of truth for Section 06.
 *
 * PURE FRONTEND: there is no CMS, database, API or backend pricing source.
 * Everything the pricing register renders is authored here; the component in
 * components/sections/Membership.tsx consumes this verbatim and never hardcodes
 * a price, name, duration, label or CTA. To re-price the site for a real gym,
 * edit ONLY this file.
 *
 * Do not add discounts, savings, "best value" / "most popular" tags, urgency,
 * scarcity or guarantees — none of those exist in this contract by design.
 *
 * PRICE STATUS
 *   "exact"   -> render the numeric `price`, INR-formatted.
 *   "contact" -> render `contactLabel` ("Consult management") instead of an
 *                amount; `price` may be omitted.
 *   "hidden"  -> the entry does not render publicly at all.
 * Change a single plan's `priceStatus` to move it between these states without
 * touching the component.

/**
 * GRAVITY 9 FITNESS CENTRE pricing/membership data — Section 06.
 *
 * TEMPLATE DEMO PRICING PRESERVED (prospect-demo rules, Cases B/C/E):
 *
 * docs/Gym-research.md PRICING: Gravity 9 does not publish pricing
 * (`publishes_pricing_publicly: false`) and every plan — daily, weekly,
 * monthly, quarterly, half-year, annual, special training and joining fee —
 * is NOT_FOUND. The research's local-market range is explicitly not a Gravity
 * 9 tariff and is not used.
 *
 * All amounts below are therefore the existing TEMPLATE DEMO prices and are
 * NOT verified Gravity 9 prices. OWNER VERIFICATION REQUIRED before
 * final-client production.
 *
 * No "Consult management" state is used; all plans stay `priceStatus:
 * "exact"` so the pricing cards remain visible. The festival offer engine
 * (lib/festival-offers.ts) references the `half-year` and `annual` plan IDs
 * below — do not rename those IDs. No second pricing or offer calculation
 * exists; the engine derives every discounted amount from these prices.
